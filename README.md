BridgeChat
==========

This project has sought to combine multiple technologies, old and new, to create an entirely web-based video conferencing application using WebRTC. The project, given the codename ‘Bridge Chat’, consists of three main pieces: The Client, Custom Server, and the Proxy Server. The client is the largest and most complex portion, containing 5 functional entities, and is intended to stand alone, requiring only a single HTML DIV element and a minimal amount of CSS.
